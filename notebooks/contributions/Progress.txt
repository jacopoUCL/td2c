Computational cost reduction
    Done some variable (descriptors) selection but lost the files, need to rebuild the notebooks.
    Once done we can reduce the number of descriptors and try to run the methods to see if results are similar.
    
Linear processes validation
    Done validation with LOPO on the three linear processes (18, 19 and 20).
    Done validation using as train the three linear processes (18, 19 and 20). 
    Used outputs in teh real-world data validation.

td2c extensions
    Done the algos and functions for MB td2c exgensions.
    Can do a couple more (see IPad).
    Done the notebook to compare the different methods.
    Missing how to handle when cmiknn doesn't have a number like cmiknn_3 in the notebook's declaration of the method.
    Need to test all the new functions.

Real data validation
    Tested the datasets from Hybrid paper, bad results even lowering the treshold for classification.
    Tried with model trained only on linear model, bad results as well.
    Need to add confusion matrices.
    Should try with bigger datasets (could be better given what written in td2c paper conclusion)
    Could try with CauseMe.
