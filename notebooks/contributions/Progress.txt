Computational cost resuction
    Done some variable (descriptors) selection but lost the files, need to rebuild the notebooks
    
Linear processes validation

td2c extensions
    Set up the notebook, missing only classification and plots for comparisons.
    missing the TD2C in the pas method.
    missing how to handle when cmiknn doesn't have a number like cmiknn_3 in the nnotebook's declaration of the method

Real data validation
    tested the datasets from Hybrid... paper, bad results even lowering the treshold for classification
    should try with bigger datasets (could be better given what written in td2c paper conclusion)

Useful notebooks
