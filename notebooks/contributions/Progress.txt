Computational cost resuction
    Done some variable (descriptors) selection but lost the files, need to rebuild the notebooks
    
Linear processes validation

td2c extensions
    Set up work by listing some possible modifications of MI computation and MB estimation

Real data validation
    tested the datasets from Hybrid... paper, bad results even lowering the treshold for classification
    should try with bigger datasets (could be better given what written in td2c paper conclusion)

Useful notebooks
